***OBSERVATIONS***


1: "Run your program and observe the results for different number of processes."
---ran program with small number of processes and large number. runs smoothly

2:

3: "Experiment with different values for the number of processes up to a maximum of 100 processes. Observe the fraction
that are adopted by init."
---There were approximately 23 orphans adopted by INIT in this test

4:

5:"Put a loop around the final fprintf in your code. Have the loop execute k times. Put sleep(m); inside this loop
just before the fprintf statement. Pass k and m using command line options.(I think there was a typo in the P1 prompt. I think it meant s and i) Run the program for several values of n, k, and m. Observe the results."
---Ran the program several times with several different values. time it takes seems to be k*m (s*i) so as long as those are fairly small the program wont take too long. also ran with several values for n
